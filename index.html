                        <p>
                            With limited access to healthcare and support systems during the pandemic, there is an
                            <b>alarming</b> rise in sexual and domestic violence cases following the pandemic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lockdowns and economic uncertainties have further exacerbated the situation.
                        </p>
                        <p>According to the WHO, in 2021, <b>245 million</b> women and girls were reportedly
                            sexually/physically abused annually [3].</p>
                        <p>
                            It is a sad reality that the majority of cases involving violence against women have been
                            committed by their partners or spouses, rather than by experienced criminals.
                        </p>
                        <p>The WHO has also reported a decline in healthcare services extended to women who have been
                            victims of domestic violence in <b>56%</b> of African countries.</p>

                            While research on the topic is ongoing, some evidence suggests that pregnant women are at a

                        <p>
                            There is also a possibility that COVID-19 may be transmitted to the baby during pregnancy or
                            childbirth.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However, the good news is such cases have been very rarely reported, and therefore, babies
                            born
                            to pregnant women who have been sick with COVID-19 during their pregnancy are not exposed to
                            any
                            severe health issues.
                        </p>
                        <p>Having said that, there has been some research that suggests that pregnant women with the
                            coronavirus infection are more likely to;

                    First of all, you need to be watchful of the following symptoms when you're pregnant or have

                    <p>
                        If you experience these symptoms, you must get in touch with your healthcare provider right
                        away.
                    </p>
                    <p>Doctors usually recommend a <b>monoclonal antibody medication</b> to pregnant women if they get
                        infected by the coronavirus. This treatment involves a single infusion of a monoclonal antibody
                        medicine intravenously.

                    </p>
                    <p>It is recommended to contact your doctor right after you experience COVID-19 symptoms because
                        this medication is the most effective when given at the start of the infection.</p>
                    <p>The CDC recommends that postpartum women take precautionary measures seriously to protect
                        themselves from the virus, such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and washing
                        hands frequently.

            <p>According to the CDC, it is perfectly safe for women to get vaccinated while pregnant or breastfeeding
                [4]. </p>
            <p>In fact, getting vaccinated if you're pregnant is highly recommended because research shows pregnant

                    It's a common misconception that COVID-19 may cause fertility problems in men and women.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>Some theories have also been circulating since 2020 that COVID-19 vaccines may cause early pregnancy
                loss.</p>
            <p>
                Although these beliefs are not backed by scientific proof or study results, people may start believing
                them out of fear or uncertainty.
            </p>
            <p>
                A study conducted in 2022 [5] has confirmed that there is no association between fertility problems and
                COVID-19 vaccines.

                These psychiatric illnesses are being seen as the aftermath of COVID-19, and they are not to be taken
                lightly.
                Even small daily changes like sleep and appetite disturbances and emotional distress must NOT be ignored
                or

                    <strong>Changes in State-Funded Medicaid Program After May 2023</strong>
                    </h3>
                    <p class="text-white">With the expiration of the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) in May 2023,
                        it has been estimated that up to <b>18 million</b> people could potentially lose Medicaid
                        coverage.</p>
                    <p class="text-white">While this figure itself is alarming, recent surveys show that approximately
                        3.8 million people in the country would be uninsured after disenrollment from Medicaid and
                        re-enrollment to other programs like CHIP [10].</p>
                    <p class="text-white">This means that a significant portion of the population may not have access to
                        free COVID tests, vaccines, and hospital care once the PHE ends in May.</p>
                    <p class="text-white">The above stats raise concerns about potential impact of PHE expiration on
                        vulnerable populations, particularly those with chronic health conditions or disabilities.</p>
                    <p class="text-white">Here is an overview of a few changes that are expected to take place for
                        uninsured and underinsured people after the PHE ends in May 2023; </p>

                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white">This means that those without insurance will have to find alternative

                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white">If you have Medicare insurance, you can still order up to 8 at-home
                            COVID-19 tests. However, people who were enrolled in Medicaid during the pandemic will be
                            required to purchase these tests from their pocket if their physician advises them.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), the cost of these tests
                            will vary according to an individual's insurance status.</p>

                            after the PHE expires. This transition would not only result in changes to the cost of
                            COVID-19 treatment, but also to the way that healthcare providers are reimbursed for their
                            services.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white">Medicare beneficiaries will continue to see some sort of cost sharing for
                            the treatments. In addition, people covered under Medicaid programs will be reimbursed for

                <ul>
                    <li>Cervical cytology (Pap test)</li>

                    patients due to the pandemic. A number of cases have been reported in which women feel hesitant to
                    visit a healthcare facility for screenings due to fear of getting the infection.</p>

                <p>The use of contraceptives has significantly changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is mainly true
                    for hormonal contraceptives for women that are accessible only with a prescription as well as
                    implant and intrauterine contraceptive devices [8].</p>
                <p>If you want to book a face-to-face contraceptive consultation or discuss your preferred choice of
                    family planning with a specialist, visit HCPSC.</p>
                <p>It is particularly important to consult a healthcare professional for family planning if you have had

                    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the importance of comprehensive maternity services for

                        given birth are at a particularly high risk of experiencing severe complications from COVID-19
                        [9].</p>

                        to an ICU, or put on a ventilator. Being older than 25 years, having an underlying health
                        condition like diabetes, and being Hispanic or Black [2] may increase your risk of getting
                        severely ill from COVID-19. </p>

                <strong>Final Thoughts</strong>
            </h5>
            <p>The pandemic has led to the postponement or cancellation of routine and emergency medical procedures,
                leading to delayed diagnoses and treatment.</p>
            <p>It has particularly been challenging for women as they have difficulty accessing quality and timely
                healthcare. Delayed prenatal and postnatal care have had severe consequences for both mother and child.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, the pandemic has had a disproportionate economic impact on women, many of whom work in
                healthcare or other essential industries, increasing the burden of the pandemic on their physical and
                mental health.</p>
            <p>As the world continues to grapple with the effects of COVID-19, it is crucial to prioritize the provision
                of essential health services for women and ensure that they receive the care they need to maintain their
                health and well-being.</p>
            <p>If you're a woman struggling with a health issue after being diagnosed with COVID-19, contact a
                specialist immediately.
